    content: `
      <p>In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is not just the responsibility of security teams‚Äîit's a critical skill every developer must master. As cyber threats continue to evolve, developers play a crucial role in building secure applications from the ground up.</p>
      
      <h2>Understanding Common Vulnerabilities</h2>
      <p>The OWASP Top 10 provides a comprehensive list of the most critical security risks to web applications. Understanding these vulnerabilities is the first step in building secure software.</p>
      
      <h2>Secure Coding Practices</h2>
      <p>Implementing secure coding practices from the beginning of development is far more effective than trying to patch security holes later. This includes input validation, proper authentication, and secure data handling.</p>
      
      <h2>Regular Security Audits</h2>
      <p>Regular security audits and penetration testing help identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.</p>

    excerpt:
      "Explore how Figma's latest feature bridges the gap between design and development with real-time handoff tools.",
    content: `
      <p>In the ever-evolving world of digital product design, collaboration between designers and developers has always been a crucial‚Äîyet often challenging‚Äîpart of the process. On April 25th, Figma introduced Dev Mode, a powerful new feature aimed at streamlining that collaboration more than ever before.</p>
      
      <h2>ü§î What is Dev Mode?</h2>
      <p>Dev Mode is a new interface within Figma that provides developer-focused tools and removes unnecessary UI clutter that designers typically use. Instead, developers get ready-to-implement specs, such as spacing, color values, font styles, and asset exports‚Äîwithout disrupting the design file or asking the design team for clarifications.</p>
      
      <h2>ü§ù Bridging the Gap Between Design & Development</h2>
      <p>Traditionally, handing off designs involved back-and-forth communication, misunderstandings, and occasional delays. With Dev Mode, handoff becomes real-time and seamless:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Live Design Specs:</strong> Developers can inspect the design without needing additional tools or extensions.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Snippets:</strong> Automatically generated CSS, iOS (Swift), and Android (XML) code help speed up implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Version History Access:</strong> Stay aligned with design updates without asking for a new export every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Comments:</strong> Developers can leave feedback directly in the design file.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>üöÄ Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>For design teams working in agile environments, the speed of handoff can make or break a sprint. Figma's Dev Mode turns a typically messy phase into a collaborative, real-time experience that reduces errors, shortens build times, and improves the designer-developer relationship.</p>
      
      <h2>üîÆ Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Whether you're a solo designer working with freelance developers or part of a large product team, Figma's Dev Mode introduces a smoother, smarter way to collaborate. It's not just a feature‚Äîit's a shift in how digital products are built.</p>
